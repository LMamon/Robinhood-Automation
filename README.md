This is not a robo-trader but uses the library/api for robinhood and python. My first real use of APIs to extract data from a robinhood account. Will be using the data ad building blocks for a bigger project down the line

API/library from https://github.com/jmfernandes/robin_stocks/tree/master

List of Functions and Example Usage

For a complete list of all Robinhood API functions and what the different parameters mean, go to robin-stocks.com Robinhood Page. If you would like to see some example code and instructions on how to set up two-factor authorization for Robinhood, go to the Robinhood Documentation.
